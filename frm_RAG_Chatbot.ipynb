While we were waiting for Microsoft \\nto fix the issues with the previous versions and to \\nbegin advertising the current products, it was \\ndoing something different that, with the benefit \\nof hindsight, looks to have been the perfect \\nchoice. Microsoft collected the feedback of \\nusers, carefully considered what was missing in \\nthe world of end-user BI, and then crafted the \\nversion of Power BI that’s available to you today. \\nPower BI is an evolution of the add-ins \\npreviously available in Excel: Power Pivot, Power \\nQuery, and Power View. You can use Power BI \\nwith or without Excel—\\nyou no longer are \\ndependent on the version of Microsoft Office \\ninstalled at your company. People did not like to \\nshare reports by using only SharePoint, and \\nMicrosoft moved away from it. Users wanted a \\nmobile experience, and the development team \\ncreated it. Data analysts wanted power, \\nsimplicity, new visualizations, and all of this is \\nnow available in Power BI. In addition, a lot of \\neffort went into the creation of a seamless \\nexperience in loading data from many different \\ncloud sources and building the infrastructure \\nneeded to provide all BI enthusiasts with a \\nframework with which they can grow their \\nreports, share them with their teams, and refresh \\nthe data in a simple yet effective way.'),\n",
